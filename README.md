# Road-Accident-Analysis

In this project, I've developed a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022, aiming to enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization by Md Rahmatullah.

Key highlights of the dashboard include:

-Primary KPIs: Total casualties post-accident, with a detailed breakdown by severity, and identification of maximum casualties by vehicle type.
-Monthly Trends Analysis: Year-on-year comparisons to discern patterns and changes over time.
-Road Type Analysis: Delving into casualty distribution across different road types.
-Geographic Analysis: Mapping casualties by area/location and day/night occurrences for detailed insights.

My approach emphasized:

-Data Visualization Mastery: Creating visually intuitive representations using pivot tables and charts to enhance understanding.
-Rigorous Data Gathering: Ensuring data accuracy through careful sourcing and verification.
-Insightful Data Analysis: Employing various analytical techniques to extract meaningful insights.

This project has been an excellent opportunity to sharpen my Excel skills and deepen my understanding of data analysis concepts.
